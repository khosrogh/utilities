# User-Defined Functions Extractor

This Python script extracts and prints the names of user-defined functions in the current environment. It filters out built-in functions and modules to provide a list of only user-defined functions.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the script: [user_defined_functions_extractor.py](user_defined_functions_extractor.py)

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python user_defined_functions_extractor.py
   ```

5. The script will print the names of user-defined functions in the current environment.

## Notes

- The script uses the `inspect` module to retrieve information about the current environment.
- It filters out Python built-in functions and modules, providing a list of only user-defined functions.
- If an ImportError occurs while importing a module, an error message is printed, and the script continues with the next module.
